## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about CSS Grid. It was difficult to understand at first.


### Continued development

At first I wanted to use grid area but it's not working properly so I decided to go with grid row, grid column lines.

I will continue to practice on how to use flexbox and grid together to build a responsive website



### Useful resources
